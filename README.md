## Overview

My updated portfolio showcases 3 of my top coding projects which are MyAnime, WeatherApp, and Me Vs U. Each project demonstrates not only my affinity for great UI/UX design but also javascript functionality. I love to keep things simple and yet, active. I believe that a simple, clean and striking design can enhance the user experience and elevate the backend intentions. Enjoy!
